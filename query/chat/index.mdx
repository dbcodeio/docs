## Chat Feature in DBCode  

The Chat feature in DBCode lets you interact with your database by querying and modifying data directly within Visual Studio Code. With support for both SQL commands and natural language inputs, it simplifies database management and boosts productivity.  

### Prerequisites  

- **GitHub Copilot Extension and Subscription:**  
  - To use the Chat feature, you must install the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.  

  - A valid GitHub Copilot subscription is required for the Chat feature to function.  

- **Alternative Option:**  
  - If you don’t have a GitHub Copilot subscription, you can still utilize DBCode’s **Inline Completion** feature for real-time query suggestions and completion directly in the editor. For detailed information , check out the [Inline Completion](/docs/query/inline-completion)

### Using the Chat Feature  

1. **Submit Queries or Commands:**  
   - Type your questions or commands into the chat box at the bottom of the Chat panel, prefixed with `@dbcode`.  

   - Use natural language (e.g., *“Show me all customers who purchased in the last month”*) or SQL syntax for your queries.

2. **View Query Results:**  
   - Query responses are displayed directly in the Chat panel, allowing you to review results without switching contexts.

   - For each response, click the `Copy` icon to extract the auto-generated SQL query for use elsewhere.

4. **Use Copied Queries:**  
   - Paste the copied SQL query into an SQL file or DBCode notebook connected to your database to execute and analyze the query.  

   - When done, close the Chat panel or leave it open for ongoing interactions.
