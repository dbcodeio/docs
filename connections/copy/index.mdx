4. **Modify the Duplicate Connection (if needed):**
   - After clicking on `Copy Connection`, a `New Connection` tab with the same settings will appear in the main area as shown below. You can rename or modify any details, such as the server name, username, or connection name.

   - Once you have adjusted the settings (if necessary), save the copied connection.

## Why Use Copy Connection

- **Quick Setup for Similar Databases:** If youâ€™re working with multiple databases on the same server or with similar configurations, copying a connection saves time by duplicating settings.

- **Experimenting with Variations:** Copying allows you to create variations of a connection for testing purposes without affecting the original settings.
