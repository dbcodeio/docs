## Connect a Cloud Provider

Using a cloud provider grants access to all databases within that provider without needing to configure each one individually.

For more information, check out the [connect a cloud provider](/docs/cloud-providers) article.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and click on the DBCode icon in the activity bar (usually on the left-hand side).

2. Click the "Explore With a Sample Database" button from the explorer. Or open the command palette *Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P* and select the "DBCode: Explore With a Sample Database" option.

3. Select the “Sample Database” option.
