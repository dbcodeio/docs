description: Automatically add database connections found in .env and web.config files, or supported .db files.

## How It Works

### Config Files

DBCode looks for database connection information (either as a connection string or configuration) in the following locations within the root folder:

1. **Env files (*.env):** Files that contain environment variables including database connection strings.
2. **Web Config files (web.config):** Configuration files used by web applications that may include database connection settings.
3. **DDev (.ddev/config.yaml):** YAML files used by DDev for configurations, including database connection details.

If connection information is found and successfully parsed from these files, DBCode will automatically add it as a database connection.

### Compatiable .db files

DBCode also scans for compatible database files for supported databases in the root directory (currently .db file for SQLite). If such a file is found, it will be automatically added as a database connection.

## Discovered Connections

Automatically discovered connections are indicated by a compass icon (ðŸ§­), making it easy to identify and manage them.

## Additional Config Types

We recognize that there are many other types of configuration files and formats used for database connections.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/dbcodeio/public/issues) if you have specific configuration file types or formats that you need DBCode to support.
