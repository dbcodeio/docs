## Requirements

To set up Supabase with DBCode, you will need an access token.

You can obtain an access token by following the instructions provided on the <a href="https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens" target="_blank">Access Tokens</a> page in the dashboard.

### Important Note

**Database User Creation**: For the Supabase provider to work, DBCode creates a user in your database when you first connect to it. This user is called `dbcode` and is granted the `postgres` role. The password for this user is not stored and will be changed if you reconnect.

## Connecting

Once you have your access token, follow the steps in the [connect a cloud provider](/docs/cloud-providers/connect) article.
