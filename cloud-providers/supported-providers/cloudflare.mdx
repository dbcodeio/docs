## Requirements

To set up Cloudflare with DBCode, you will need to use an API token. 

You can obtain your API key by following the instructions provided on the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/" target="_blank">Create Token page</a>. 

The API Token should have the following permissions:

- Account - Account Settings - Read
- Account - D1 - Edit

## Connecting

Once you have your API token, follow the steps in the [connect a cloud provider](/docs/cloud-providers/connect) article.
