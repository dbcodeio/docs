3. **Update Connection Details:**
   - A settings panel will open, allowing you to adjust the following details:
     - **Server Name:** Update the connection name if needed.
     - **Type:** Modify the database type (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) if it has changed.
     - **Host:** Change the server’s host address, such as updating to a new IP or domain.
     - **Port:** Update the port number if the server port has changed (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL).
     - **Username:** Enter a new username if access credentials have changed.
     - **Password:** Update the password for secure access.
     - **Database:** Adjust the database name if connecting to a different one within the same server.

4. **Save the Updated Connection:**
   - After making the necessary changes, click **Save** to apply the updates to the connection.

   DBCode will test the new settings to ensure the connection works correctly. If any details are incorrect, you’ll receive an error message to help troubleshoot.
