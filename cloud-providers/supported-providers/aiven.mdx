## Requirements

To set up Aiven with DBCode, you will need an authentication token.

You can obtain an authentication token by following the instructions provided on the <a href="https://aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token" target="_blank">Create authentication tokens</a> page.

### SSL Certificates

Several Aiven services require project-specific SSL certificates. DBCode will automatically download and use these certificates when connecting to Aiven services via the Aiven cloud provider.

## Connecting

Once you have your authentication token, follow the steps in the [connect a cloud provider](/docs/cloud-providers/connect) article.
