## Overview

SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and is widely used in enterprise applications. SQL Server provides a range of features and capabilities, including support for complex queries, indexing, and geospatial data.

## Supported Authentiction Methods

DBCode supports the following authentication methods for SQL Server:

- SQL Based Username and password
- Microsoft Entra ID (via Azure SQL)
- Windows Integrated Authentication

In addition to the above authentication, DBCode also supports connecting to named instances of SQL Server.
