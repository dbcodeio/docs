4. **Load the Latest Data and Structure:**
   - DBCode will refresh the connection, updating the list of tables, views, and any new or modified database objects.
   - This is useful if changes have been made to the database structure or data by other users or processes.

5. **Confirmation:**
   - Once refreshed, you will see an updated list of tables and other objects, ensuring you’re working with the most current version of the database.

## When to Use Refresh

- **Data or Structure Updates:** Use refresh whenever new tables, columns, or data have been added to or modified in the database.
- **Sync Changes from Other Users:** Refresh to see changes made by other users if you’re collaborating on the same database.
