3. **Open the Chat Panel:**
   - Make sure you have the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, as it is required for the Chat feature to function.

   - Once installed, locate the **Chat** icon on the sidebar, typically shown as a text bubble icon on the right side of the table view. Click it to open the Chat panel.

4. **Use the Copied Query in the SQL Editor/DBCode Notebook:**
   - After copying the SQL query, you can paste it into an SQL file or DBCode notebook with the same connection and database to execute the query and view the output.

   - When finished, you can close the Chat panel to return to the database view or keep it open for ongoing interactions.
