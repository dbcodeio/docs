## Deleting a Database Connection

Deleting a connection in DBCode is a straightforward way to remove any connections you no longer need, keeping your workspace organized and focused.

1. **Open DBCode in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code and click on the DBCode icon in the Activity Bar (usually on the left side).

2. **Locate the Connection to Delete:**
   - In the DBCode explorer, find the connection you wish to delete. Ensure it is disconnected before proceeding.

3. **Delete the Connection:**
   - Right-click on the connection name and select **Delete Connection** from the context menu.

   - Alternatively, you can click on the `Delete Connection` icon beside connection name as shown below.

   - A confirmation prompt will appear. Click **Yes** to confirm and permanently remove the connection.

4. **Connection Removed:**
   - The connection will be deleted from your list, and it will no longer be accessible in DBCode. 
   
   - If you need to connect to this database again, you will have to recreate the connection.For more information, check out the [create connection](docs/connections/create) article.

## Important Notes

- **Deleting a Grouped Connection:** If the connection youâ€™re deleting is part of a group, only the specific connection will be deleted, not the entire group.

- **Data Safety:** Deleting a connection in DBCode only removes the saved connection details. It does not delete any data in the database itself.

Deleting unused connections in DBCode keeps your workspace clean and organized, allowing you to focus on active databases.
